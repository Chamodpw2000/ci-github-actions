CD Pipeline is responsible to update the kubernetes custer with the new image.

CD tools --> Ansible , Shell Scripting , Python with Helm charts

Gitops is a modern way of doing CD. Tools - ArgoCD , FluxCD
In gitops Kubernetes manifests updated in CI stage is saved in a version control system like github.
CD tool will monitor these changers and update the target environment.

Most of the times version control system is github and target environment is a kubernetes cluster.

Advantages of GitOps approach

1. Automatic - once the manifests are updated in the repo, CD tool will automatically update the target environment.
2. Reconciliation of state - if there are any manual changes in the target environment, CD tool will revert it back to the desired state so version control system is the single source of truth.
3. Audit trail - all the changes are tracked in the version control system.
