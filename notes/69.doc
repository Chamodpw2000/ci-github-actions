Install ArgoCD in the kubernetes cluster

kubectl create namespace argocd

tells Kubernetes to create a new namespace called argocd in your cluster. 
Namespaces are used to organize and isolate resources (like pods, services, etc.) 
within a Kubernetes cluster. In this case, you are preparing a separate space for 
installing and managing ArgoCD and its resources.

within this namespace, install argocd

kubectl apply -n argocd -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/argoproj/argo-cd/stable/manifests/install.yaml

verify the installation

kubectl get pods -n argocd
This command lists all the pods running in the argocd namespace. You should see several pods related 
to ArgoCD, such as argocd-server, argocd-repo-server, argocd-application-controller, etc. 
Ensure that all pods are in the Running state before proceeding.

kubectl get svc -n argocd

This command lists all the services running in the argocd namespace.

Among the services, you should see one named argocd-server. This service is responsible for exposing the ArgoCD API server.

To access the ArgoCD UI, you can port-forward the argocd-server service to your local machine.

kubectl edit svc argocd-server -n argocd

Change the type in to LoadBalancer from ClusterIP

Now you can access the ArgoCD UI using the external IP address assigned to the argocd-server service by the LoadBalancer.

Kubectl get secrets -n argocd
This command lists all the secrets in the argocd namespace. Look for a secret named argocd-initial-admin-secret.

This secret contains the initial admin password for ArgoCD.

kubectl edit secret argocd-initial-admin-secret -n argocd

with this command we can get the password in plain text

This password is base64 encoded, so you will need to decode it to get the actual password.

echo <base64-encoded-password> | base64 --decode

and get password, sign in with username admin and the password you just decoded from argocd UI.

ArgoCD can deploy applications to the same cluster where it is installed (the in-cluster setup) or to external clusters (the out-of-cluster setup).
