Writing a github action for CI/CD

1. create .github/workflows directory in the repo
2. create a yml file in the above directory (name it whatever you want)
3. github provides actions that are like plugins to do certain tasks.

Main parts of a github actions workflow file

1. name - name of the workflow
2. on - events that will trigger the workflow
3. jobs - a workflow run is made up of one or more jobs. For ease of understanding, troubleshooting we can 
group the tasks into jobs. Jobs run on a runner (a VM hosted by github or self hosted)

parts of a job
1. name - name of the job
2. runs-on - type of runner (ubuntu, windows, macos)
3. steps - a job contains one or more steps. A step is either a shell script that will be executed or an action that will be run.
